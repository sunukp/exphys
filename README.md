# Estimate power output

Cycling is a well researched sports primarily because it provides a highly reproducible and controlled exercise mode. 
It allows researchers to precisely manipulate variables such as intensity (by adjusting resistance or terrain), duration, and frequency. 
The availability of advanced sensors and their portability contribute to control. The sensors are capable of precisely measuring various
physiological parameters such as power output, cadence, heart rate, and speed. 
These attributes make cycling an ideal field of sports conducive to the study of the relationship between power output and other physiological parameters.

The ultimate goal of this project is to estimate power output for various human activities using affordable and portable sensors. 
The study of cycling is a stepping stone towards that goal.

The initial set of bike sensors we utilize are:
- Garmin Edge 1040 Bike Computer with GPS (lat/lon, speed, altitude)
- Garmin HRM-Pro chest strap heart-rate monitor
- Garmin Varia RTL515 bike radar (vehicle count and speed)
- SRAM Quarq Rival AXS power meter (power, cadence)
